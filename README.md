## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## The Course Project from Coursera for the Data Science Specialization Track
# The script called run_analysis.R is created to meet the course requirements which are listed down below:

## You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
## 1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## 2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
## 3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## 4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
## 5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## To run the script, download the dataset from the link provided below:
# https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

## Make sure the script is in the same folder as the extracted zip folder.
# Within the directory, you should see the UCI HAR Dataset folder and the run_analysis.R script.

## Once the above has been met, run the script and there will be an output file of tidy data.
